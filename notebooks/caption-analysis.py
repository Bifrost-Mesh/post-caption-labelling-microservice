    Spent an amazing night in the heart of Copenhagen, with 2 of my lovely colleagues ❤️
    @codingsafari and @johannesholzel.

    We talked primarily about CloudNative Distributed Systems, Data stream processing using Apache
    Flink and building Recommendation Engines.

    And dammnn! Those pastries were real good....😋
